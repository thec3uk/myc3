## connect group questions

1. Each share one thing that God spoke to you about through the message on Sunday.

2. Which of the three lessons from David's heart do you find most challenging? Why?
3. Which of the three lessons from David's heart would you like to develop in your own life? Why?
4. What can we learn from David's life that can help us avoid making the same mistakes?
5. Think about a time when you failed. In what way did this experience cause you to reset and renew you heart towards God?
6. How would you describe your heart towards God at the moment? Do you feel close to God or distant from God? Why do you think that is? What steps can you take to keep drawing near to God?
7. Take a moment to reflect on how the person next to you reveals a heart after God. Take it turns to encourage one another.
