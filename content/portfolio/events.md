## Hillsong (London) Worship Night

Join us for a night of worship led by the band from Hillsong, London. Doors open at 6.15 for this night of exuberant praise.

We believe we are all called to passionate and genuine worship of our Lord Jesus Christ, and joining together to sing His praise fuels this passion within us.

We believe that there is power in giving praise that comes from the heart and is sung in Jesus' name; power to break the chains that bind us whether that be from physical, emotional, mental or spiritual troubles.

We believe that there is a beauty when a thousand tongues sing as one to Almighty God.

We believe that festival days of worship equip us to be the ones who God designs us to be in his world.
